				<h4>
					<a name='OpenSource'>Open Source</a>
				</h4>
				Open Source projects have different flavours of licenses:
				<ul className='list-unstyled'>
					<li>The Apache License</li>
					<li>MIT License</li>
					<li>GNU General Public License (GPL)</li>
					<li>BSD Licenses</li>
					<li>GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</li>
					<li>Mozilla Public License (MPL)</li>
				</ul>
				Licenses like GPL say that if your code is consumed by another project
				that project must also add the GPL license, you cannot protect your
				intellectual property or prevent others from making cash out of your
				license. You cannot consume a GPL component and then create a private
				proprietary license that hides your source code and prevents others
				monetings from it.
				<br />
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name='ClosedSource'>Closed Source</a>
				</h4>
				Closed Source projects are private.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				<h4>
					<a name='MonetisationEffortBased'>
						Monetisation Effort Based Licenses
					</a>
				</h4>
				These projects have licenses that specify that in the event of
				monetisation, monies shall be distributed in proportion to effort as
				measured by git contributions. This mimics creating companies and share
				holdings except the % sharing is dynamic and there is no red tape or
				cost for maintaining the shares.
