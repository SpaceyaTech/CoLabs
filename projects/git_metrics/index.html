              JD (John Dickerson) is a Brit who has relocated to Kenya and married a Kikuo. JD has
              an interest in decentralised software that protects the freedoms of people and allows
              them to collaborate to achieve great things. JD has worked in low latency trading
              platforms and dot com companies in Europe. JD is currently trying to help young people
              set up software operations; find jobs and build experience. JD has 20 years plus
              coding in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              JD is playing an active role in introducing and architecting some project concepts in
              SpaceYaTech. Namely:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Each member of SpaceYaTech has a "Software House on Standby" and SpaceYaTech can
                hold your hand on how to: write tenders to win contracts; how to set up umbrella
                companies for payroll, how to use Feature Driven Development and Feature payment
                to reduce risk to all stakeholders.
              </li>
              <li>
                Licenses can have monetisation clauses which state that in the event of
                monetisation, monies shall be distributed in proportion to effort as measured
                by git contributions.
              </li>
              <li>
                By the time you graduate your CV should have 7 SpaceYaTech projects on it. Each
                project owner can give you referencves on demand.
              </li>
